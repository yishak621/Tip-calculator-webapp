## My process

to build these web app i use js and css for the most part of the process and also in the html i added data-id and data-value
to mark my elments in unique ways for the javascript.the main logic is to calculate the tip amount per person and total expenditure per person for a random group of people and i dont think anyone could have encounter maths issues in these challenges but the main task in these project is to think scenarios(cases) and to prepare reaction for that in the javascript
as a programmer , these small web app requier to think diffrent scenarios(cases)
case-1]when a user didn't click(add values) on the bill input and also when a user didn'click on the rate btn
case-2]when a user insert a 0 value to person input[cant be 0 warning]
case-3]when a user insert in custom input and changes idea to click the rate btn and vice versa
case-4]when a user insert a 0 value to the bill input
and also a reset btn have a set back to default functionality which will restore everything

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

to be honest these is a best excercise to practice java basics Math methods like ParseInt(),.Fixed(),parseFloat() but for the most of it
it helps me to test my ability with events specially 'keyup' events.
i added some overshot javascript sauces ....enjoy it
